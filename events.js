// RIC EVENTS DATA
// =============================================================================
// This is the only file you should need to edit to add, change, or remove
// an event. To add a new event:
//
//   1. Upload the flyer image into the /assets folder.
//   2. Copy one of the blocks below (from the opening { to the closing },
//      including the comma after it) and paste it into the `events` list.
//   3. Fill in the fields for your event (see notes on each field below).
//   4. Commit and push to GitHub. GitHub Pages will publish it automatically
//      within a minute or two.
//
// To remove an event early, just delete its block (or its whole entry).
// Events also disappear automatically the day after they expire, so most
// past events don't need to be manually deleted.
